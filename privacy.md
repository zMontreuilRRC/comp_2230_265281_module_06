## Tracking
Recording user activity across different websites, using things like cookies, referer headers (sent via http request to say where a request is sent from), and other methods.

## Fingerprinting
- Programs track user activity across different websites covertly and build up sets of data about them
- Modern browsers are working out how to prevent fingerprinting as an ongoing process
